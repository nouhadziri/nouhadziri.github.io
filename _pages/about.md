I'm a research scientist at [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/) working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).
Currently, **I  lead the safety and post-training effort at AI2** to build [(OLMO)](https://allenai.org/olmo): a highly capable and truly open LLM to advance AI.

Besides this, I work on understanding the **limits of Transformers** and their inner workings. Check out "[Faith and Fate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18654)" to learn about the limits of Transformers on reasoning tasks.
I also work on studying **alignment in LLMs**; checkout "[Roadmap to Pluralistic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05070)", "[Finegrained RLHF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01693)", and "[RewardBench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13787)" the first evaluation tool for reward models..

My work has been featured in [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/23/treating-a-chatbot-nicely-might-boost-its-performance-heres-why/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFGYVLMFUWxvSeJ-pBGGhl4EDBRfF7TxrTSPiA0whuo31NZWxQURPlMqxsbl5msyVt61-kx4EIhdK8GQiVeW6rhU1OVMWqqHX37fwFqn8X8wAuXCPGhd9SIslHAIeXVlefOWXdcsa4D34BnNp7lnvyuC-zP38xfZtJV1UhpE6PpV), [LeMonde](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2024/06/17/faut-il-s-inquieter-des-hallucinations-des-ia-comme-chatgpt-ou-gemini_6240971_4408996.html), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/02/28/ai-models-make-stuff-up-how-can-hallucinations-be-controlled), and [Science News](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-understanding-reasoning-skill-assess).
