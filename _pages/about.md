I'm a research scientist at [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and the [Mosaic](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team.
Currently, my work revolves around three main axes:

- **Science of LMs:** Understanding the limits of Transformers and their inner workings.
- **Safety of LMs:** Make LMs safer by aligning them with human values and ethical principles.

In the past, I earned my PhD from the University of Alberta and the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca/).
I was also fortunate to work with brilliant researchers in the field.
I have worked with <a href="https://sivareddy.in/">Siva Reddy</a> at Mila/McGill, 
with <a href="https://hrashkin.github.io/index.html">Hannah Rashkin</a>, 
<a href="https://tallinzen.net/research/">Tal Linzen</a>,
<a href="http://www.david-reitter.com/">David Reitter</a>,
<a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/">Diyi Yang</a>, and 
<a href="https://research.google/people/105075/">Tom Kwiatkowski</a> at Google Research NYC 
and have worked with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/alsordon/">Alessandro Sordoni</a>, and 
[Goeff Gordon](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/) at Microsoft Research Montreal.
