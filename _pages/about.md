I'm a research scientist at [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and the [Mosaic](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team.
Currently, **I  lead the safety effort at AI2** to align [OLMO models](https://allenai.org/olmo) with ethical principles while preserving their reasoning capabilities. Besides safety, I work on 

- **Science of LMs:** Understanding the limits of Transformers and their inner workings. Check out "[Faith and Fate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18654)" to learn about the limits of Transformers on reasoning tasks.


In the past, I earned my PhD from the **University of Alberta** and the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca/) with [Osmar Zaiane](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/).
I was also fortunate to work with brilliant researchers in the field.
I have worked with <a href="https://sivareddy.in/">Siva Reddy</a> at **Mila/McGill**, 
with <a href="https://hrashkin.github.io/index.html">Hannah Rashkin</a>, 
<a href="https://tallinzen.net/research/">Tal Linzen</a>,
<a href="http://www.david-reitter.com/">David Reitter</a>,
<a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/">Diyi Yang</a>, and 
<a href="https://research.google/people/105075/">Tom Kwiatkowski</a> at **Google Research NYC** 
and have worked with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/alsordon/">Alessandro Sordoni</a>, and 
[Goeff Gordon](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/) at **Microsoft Research Montreal**.
