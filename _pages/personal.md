description: Welcome to my personal univers, where I share my interests and experiences, from AI to tennis and beyond.

When I'm not deep into LMs, I enjoy being on the tennis court or watching some intense matches in person or on TV. I'm a real tennis enthusiast, and I even plan trips just to be at grand slam tournaments.

One unforgettable moment was being in the crowd for the epic Nadal vs. Medvedev match  at the US Open finale â€“ what an experience and what a NYC crowd! I've had the pleasure of visiting some iconic tennis arenas like Wimbledon and the Australian Open, but my absolute favorite has to be the French Open. Growing up, I played on clay, watched clay matches, and fell in love with the sport on those red courts.

My current favoriate player is Carlos Alcaraz!!!!

Apart from my passion for tennis, I love being on the water. Having grown up in the Mediterranean, I have a genuine love for anything related to the sea. Seafood, in particular, is my absolute favorite cuisine. I also have a particular love for fine chocolate. So I often find myself baking a lot of chocolate cakes. 
I also enjoy kayaking, paddle boarding, whale watching, and hiking.
